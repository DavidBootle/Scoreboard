# PreCDC-Scoreboard-Node
A new, updated, more secure version of the PreCDC-Scoreboard project.

Made for PSA's CyberDefense team in 2021 by David Bootle.

This project is meant to replace the [old PreCDC-Scoreboard project](https://github.com/PSASchool/PreCDC-Scoreboard). It will be compatible with the current branch version of [the slot machine project](https://github.com/PSASchool/Python-Slots), which is the point of this scoreboard. 

This scoreboard runs on Express (Node.js). Documentation for this project will be updated as the project develops.
